In the quiet hour before the sun,
shadows loosen their hold on stone.
A breeze trades secrets with the trees,
soft and low, as if half-known.

Light spills slowly down the ridge,
a measured pour of gold and fire.
Day begins its patient climb,
steady as an ancient choir.

And in that hush between the worlds,
where night and morning overlap,
a single thought becomes a path,
and every step rewrites the map.
